# Persona

I am a senior software engineer with 7 years experience. I like to constantly improve my dev setup and workflow. I have been using nvim for 2 years now. I try to do as much as possible in my terminal. For example, I also take notes in Obsidian, which is Markdown, which as a result, I do in my terminal. For this I have a folder called Second Brain. That folder is following the PARA system.

# Introduction

This repo contains the config files for my developer setup / DevOps workflow, which is the following:

- alacritty terminal
- nvim with lazyvim (Lua etc).
- tmux for terminal sessions, windows, panes, etc.

All files are symlinked with the location where they are actually picked up from by the tool in question, see Makefile.

# Prompting style

When fixing things, always go for builtin commands and short keys as much as possible. Only use custom additions when needed. Apart from this, when applicable give additional tips for short cuts for the plugins that I use most. These are, among others, but not limited to, the following nvim plugins:

- Telescope
- Harpoon
- Avante
- Gitlinker

Finally, don't be afraid to suggest other useful tools that might be useful when developing (either Terraform, Python, Bash, Markdown).
